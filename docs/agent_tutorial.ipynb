    "# Tutorial: Creating Language Agents to interact with Aviary environments\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you in creating language agents that interact with [Aviary](https://github.com/Future-House/aviary) environments. We'll start by introducing a few basic concepts from the Aviary and [LDP](https://github.com/Future-House/ldp) frameworks, then show how to define agents that can engage with existing environments. First, we’ll build a simple agent, then extend it to create one that follows system prompts for guided interactions.\n",

    "[Aviary](https://github.com/Future-House/aviary) is our framework supporting diverse language environments, where actions are tools available to agents. [LDP](https://github.com/Future-House/ldp) is our framework for creating and training language agents.\n",

    "**From Aviary**  \n",
    "- **Message**: Used by language agents and environments for communication.\n",
    "- **Tool**: Defines an environmental tool that an agent can use to accomplish its task. Different environments offer different tools.\n",
    "- **ToolRequestMessage**, **ToolResponseMessage**: Specialized `Message` subclasses for tool requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From LDP**  \n",
    "- **Agent**: An entity that interacts with the environment, mapping observations to tool request actions.\n",
    "- **Compute Graph**: A network of operations representing data flow through an agent, storing information and parameters useful for learning. Similar to compute graphs in libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, LDP handles this internally, so in-depth knowledge isn’t necessary for this tutorial. However, some methods will have a `@compute_graph` decorator due to this structure.\n",
    "- **Op**: Represents an operation within the agent. LDP includes various operations (Ops), such as API LLM calls, API embedding calls, or PyTorch module handling. These operations form the compute graph.\n",

    "In typical reinforcement learning (RL), an agent receives an observation and generates an action while maintaining an internal state. However, as a design choice here, we make the agents independent of the state and provide them with the current state at each step. This means that the agent will receive an “agent state” containing all relevant information needed to make the next decision at any given step, instead of keeping it internally. This approach enables us, for example, to use a single agent instance to process multiple rollouts in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state includes all relevant information about a rollout in progress and required by the aget to make the next decision. In the simplest case, this comprises the current list of messages from the start of the episode and the tools available to the agent. We define such a state as follows:\n"

    "The `MySimpleAgent` class is a basic agent that utilizes a language model (LLM) to decide which tools to invoke based on observations from its environment. It manages a `MySimpleAgentState` to store relevant information. The agent's core functionality involves querying an LLM to determine the next tool request and updating its state accordingly.\n",

This value indicates the quality of the current state, which may benefit certain learning algorithms. In our case, we set it to 0.0.\n",

We’ll incorporate these guidelines to enhance our agent’s performance and ensure it consistently follows our intended framework.\n",

    "An simple example where our improved agent can be useful is the HotPotQA environment. The HotPotQA is a question-answering environment. However, the environment only considers the answer correct if it exactly matches the ground truth. Most agents tend to respond with a full sentence that, although containing the correct answer, is marked as incorrect. By providing specific guidelines, we can guide our agent to answer with only the precise information requested. Let's test this by running the environment first without guidelines, and then with them."
